Design Features:

- Professional gradient colors (blue primary, orange accents)
- Clean Inter font family for contemporary look
- High contrast and readability across all backgrounds
- Glassmorphism effects for modern UI integration

Integration notes:
- Header logo (desktop):
  <a href="index.html" class="nav-logo">
    <img src="assets/logo-primary.svg" alt="BAAZARX" style="height:44px">
  </a>

- Favicon (already added to all HTML pages):
  <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="assets/favicon.svg">

- Auth pages: Logo now has white background container for visibility against animated backgrounds

- Mobile / app icon: use `logo-square.svg` for PWA icons and social media

Color Palette:
- Primary: #1D4ED8 to #3B82F6 (blue gradient)
- Accent: #F59E0B to #EAB308 (orange/gold gradient)  
- Text: #1F2937 (dark gray)
- Background: #FFFFFF with transparency

Usage Guidelines:
- Prefer `logo-primary.svg` for website headers and marketing materials
- Use `logo-square.svg` for app icons, social thumbnails, and square contexts
- Use `logo-mono.svg` for single-color printing or high-contrast needs
- The new designs work well on both light and dark backgrounds
- No CSS filters needed - logos are pre-designed with proper contrast

The redesigned logos follow modern e-commerce trends with clean typography, professional gradients, and clear shopping context through cart iconography.

Accessibility:
- All SVGs include `role="img"` and `aria-label`. Keep these attributes when embedding.

Sizing tips:
- Keep `logo-primary` height around 40-56px in headers.
- Use `logo-square` at 40-64px for app icons.

CSS snippet for header integration:

.nav-logo img { height: 44px; display: block; }

If you want, I can update your existing header markup across HTML files to use these SVGs and generate a favicon file for you.
